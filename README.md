# Animated Marbles

Author: Mayank Sharma

## Overview
This Python script utilizes Tkinter to create a visually appealing animation featuring bouncing marbles on a canvas. The marbles exhibit dynamic movement, collisions, and a colorful display, providing an engaging visual experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Marbles:** The script generates marbles with varying sizes, colors, and initial positions.
- **Bouncing Animation:** Marbles move within the frame, bouncing off the walls with realistic physics.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions between moving marbles and a "stuck" marble, influencing their behavior.
- **Continuous Animation:** The animation runs indefinitely, creating an evolving display of marbles.

## How to Run
1. Run the script using the command: `python animated_marbles.py`.
2. Watch the animated marbles bounce around the canvas.
3. Enjoy the colorful and dynamic visual experience.

Feel free to experiment with the number of marbles, colors, or other parameters to create unique animations!
